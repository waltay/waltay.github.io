                    The website is meant for those needing to know what the weather will be like
                    that day, or in the following days, in the towns of Preston, Soda Springs, and
                    Fish Haven in Idaho. It will also be for those needing to report storms in these
                    towns.

                    almost everything on her phone. She wants to know what the weather will be like on the
                    weekend to see if it will be worth going this specific weekend. On the website, she also
                    finds it contains information about some of the main activities to do in the area.
