                The fonts used for the website will include the font 'Cinzel' for main headings and several
                other titles to accentuate and differentiate from the rest of the text. An example can be
                seen both in the website name and the title Typography. The reason for using this font is 
                that while derived from the Times New Roman family, its design contains a little more
                fluidity which helps with the image and context of weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the body will be using the font 'Arial'. The reason for this is for its simplicity 
                while also maintaining the fluidity context so that its font won't distract from the content. 
                The font sizes will vary specially considering the adaptability it needs to have for its
                use in different devices with different viewports.
