                            <p>
                                Bridal Veil Falls is a 1.4 mile-long trail which features a beautiful
                                607 foot-tall waterfall. The waterfall gives a similar appearance as a
                                bridal veil, hence the name of the waterfall and the trail. It's a very
                                simple hike suitable for all ages and goes along the Provo River which
                                results in beautiful scenery. At the parking lot there's an area with 
                                picnic tables to enjoy a meal at. There used to be a tram which would
                                take people up to a restaurant on the cliffs of the falls. Sadly, the 
                                tram was destroyed in an Avalanche and in 2008 a fire burned down most 
                                of the restaurant.

                            <h4>The Y Trail</h4>
                            <p>
                                If you've been at or passed by Provo, you'll have likely seen the iconic
                                white Y on the mountain. Well, there's a trail you can hike that will take
                                you all the way to that big white "Y". The story of why there's a Y on the 
                                mountain is that a little over a 100 years ago, the junior class of Brigham
                                Young High wanted to paint on the mountain the year in which they would graduate. 
                                The senior class got upset over this and to settle the conflict, the President
                                of Brigham Young University and the Principal of the high school opted for 
                                painting BYU on the mountain instead. On the day they would take on the task
                                of doing this, a line of high school and university students, along with
                                some professors passed buckets of lime, sand, and rocks up the mountain to fill 
                                up the letters. After six hours, only the Y had been completed, and the 
                                completion of the project was postponed and eventually abandoned, leaving only
                                the Y out of the three letters. It's a very popular hike that's not too complicated
                                in the sense of treacherous trail, but it does have some very steep inclines.
                                So if you're not used to difficult hikes, be prepared for this one. The view at
                                the top is gorgeous and provides an overview of the entire Utah Valley and the 
                                Utah Lake.
